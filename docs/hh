Online fashion hub -- fashion Internet -- fashion market
an app
users = clothes seller, tailor, stylist, fashion designers, sewing materials market, user (people buying d clothes) ... even models

every user (apart from the buyer) registers and have a unique profile that suits you (your jab)

buyer registers as an end user to pick clothes to buy, 
fashion designers gets more customer,
clothes dealers also gets more customer.

models also registers to get clients... when ever a fashion designer needs a model(for advertisment purposes)

Advantages == no more african time (from tailors), get a cheaper tailor for better quality.

everyone in d fashion business interacts.

major drawback... is measurement
vr comes in place... we design an Api that calculates your measurement based on your pics.. It exists.

several fashion designers will be interested in a centralised market for d fashion/clothes making business.
